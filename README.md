This code allows you to take your heartrate from a Heartrate sensor (MAX 30101) and display it on a LCD Display. The heartrate data is constantly being sent to a txt file. Then on a press of a button the txt file is sent to a website. In my case it is the Gauntlet website. This can be found in my profile.
